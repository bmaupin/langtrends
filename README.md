### To do
- [ ] Convert fastest growing languages to basic bump chart
- [ ] Add minimal functionality to switch between chart types
- [ ] Clean up components code
- [ ] Minor UI polish
- [ ] Minimal code to handle if API isn't available
    - [ ] Loading animation
- [ ] Publish!

### Wishlist
- [ ] Better bump chart?
    - Instead of calculating fastest growing languages for current month (with null where that language has no score
    for that month), calculate it newly for every month
    - Can react-vis support this? Would we need to create a custom chart?
